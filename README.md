# Efficiency in Order: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive **web-based sorting visualizer** that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project helps users understand how algorithms like **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort** behave and differ in efficiency.

## 🧠 Project Objective
To visualize and compare the internal working and efficiency of various sorting algorithms through animations and user interaction.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Visualization of **5 sorting algorithms**
- Adjustable **array size** and **sorting speed**
- Live stats for:
  - Comparisons  
  - Swaps  
  - Time taken  
- Start, stop, and regenerate array anytime
- Color-coded animation for better understanding:
  - 🔴 Red – Comparing  
  - 🟦 Blue – Swapping  
  - 🟩 Green – Sorted
